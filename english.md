# Galactic Linkedin profile guide

Welcome to this guide to optimizing your LinkedIn profile! Exactly like the CV guide (which you can find here ) the goal is to give you useful hints to make your LinkedIn profile attractive but above all "keyword-friendly". Being a professional social network, the purpose of the guide is simple: to get you found (assuming, of course, you want to be found ðŸ˜œ )! If you are not looking for a job, this guide can still be useful for you to better position your profile, make it more professional, and can provide you with some insights and trivia.
